# Databases
This was originally a group project for University of California, Riverside spring 2018 CS 166, Database Management Systems. The group members were Marlo Zeroth and Joshua Madrid. This was the final phase of the group project. 

The postgresSQL is the DBMS system with a java front end. 

To do:
1. Update code and comments with most recent version from most recent files not currently on github.
2. Review and revise the template code provided by lab TA.
3. Separate user interface from database model code and add a controller class (align with MVC pattern).
4. Create graphical user interface using swift as an option to command line user interface.
